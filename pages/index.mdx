I'm Stamati, a software engineer and technologist based in Minnesota. 
During the day, I work on the QA team at [MPS](https://municipalparkingservices.com), where I spend most
of my time building internal tools, writing code, and thinking about processes that aid in our manual and 
automated testing coverage.
I am naturally curious, I enjoy learning new things, and I seek to maximize value in the things I do.

Outside of work, some of the things I enjoy include reading, gaming, photography, electronic music, and going to the gym.
