# Welcome to my corner of the internet!

My name is Stamati, a software engineer who is passionate about technology, music, photography, self-improvement, and problem solving.
Currently, I spend the majority of my time working as a QA Engineer at [MPS](https://municipalparkingservices.com?ref=stamos.xyz), where I work on building internal tools 
that aid in manual and automation testing efforts.

⚠️ This page is currently a work in progress and will be changing frequently as I figure out the best way to organize my content.
