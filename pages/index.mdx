I'm Stamati, a software engineer based in Minnesota. I work at [MPS](https://municipalparkingservices.com) during the day and I freelance at night. I am naturally curious, I enjoy learning new things, and I seek to maximize value in the things I do.

Outside of work, some of the things I enjoy include reading, gaming, photography, electronic music, and going to the gym.
